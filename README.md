# Andrew_Ng_DL_Assignment
Time goes by quickly, I also accomplished 4 courses of Deep learning specialization hosted by Deeplearning.ai. Actually, the lecture is still Andrew Ng. But at this time, I don't feel sad anymore because Andrew is smiling at the end, "*To do whatever you think is the best of what you can do of humanity*." Thanks to Deeplearning.ai, I master the basic concept of deep learning.
